# Emotion Detection from Text using NLP.

A web-based application that detects emotions from user-input text using a fine-tuned **BERT** model.  
The frontend is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while the backend uses **Flask** to serve the NLP predictions.  
Predicted emotions are visualized in an interactive **Chart.js** bar chart.
